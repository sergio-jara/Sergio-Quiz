## 🚀 Advanced Concepts

### 1. Interface Segregation Principle
**Concept**: Protocols should not force clients to depend on methods they don't use
**Implementation**: Removed `ObservableObject` from service protocols
**Benefit**: Cleaner, more focused protocols

```swift
// Before: Protocol forces UI concerns
protocol RealmServiceProtocol: ObservableObject {
    func getRealm() -> Realm?
}

// After: Protocol focuses on core functionality
protocol RealmServiceProtocol {
    func getRealm() -> Realm?
}
```

### 2. Dependency Inversion Principle
**Concept**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
**Implementation**: ViewModels depend on protocols, not concrete implementations
**Benefit**: Easy testing and flexibility

```swift
// ViewModel depends on abstraction, not concretion
class QuizViewModel: BaseViewModel {
    private let apiClient: any QuizAPIClientProtocol
    private let storageService: any QuizStorageServiceProtocol
}
```

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
**Concept**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
**Implementation**: Custom error types with localized descriptions
**Benefit**: Consistent error handling across the app

```swift
enum QuizError: LocalizedError {
    case networkError
    case validationError(String)
    case storageError
    
    var errorDescription: String? {
        switch self {
        case .networkError:
            return "Network connection failed"
        case .validationError(let message):
            return "Validation error: \(message)"
        case .storageError:
            return "Storage operation failed"
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Performance Optimization
**Concept**: Efficient memory and CPU usage
**Implementation**: Value types, lazy loading, background threading
**Benefit**: Smooth user experience and efficient resource usage

```swift
// Value types for performance
struct QuizQuestion: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: UUID
    let question: String
    let correctAnswer: String
    let incorrectAnswers: [String]
}

// Lazy loading for efficiency
class ServiceContainer {
    lazy var realmService: any RealmServiceProtocol = {
        RealmService()
    }()
}
```

## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### Architecture Questions
**Q: "How did you structure your app architecture?"**
**A**: "I implemented MVVM with Dependency Injection. The app is organized by features, with each feature having its own Views, ViewModels, and Models. All services are abstracted through protocols, making the code highly testable and maintainable. I used Swift 6's `any` keyword for existential types to future-proof the codebase."

### Testing Questions
**Q: "How do you ensure code quality?"**
**A**: "I implemented a comprehensive testing strategy with 25+ unit tests covering all business logic. I use protocol-based mocking to test components in isolation, and I have integration tests for database and API operations. The CI/CD pipeline runs all tests automatically on every commit, ensuring code quality."

### Problem-Solving Questions
**Q: "Tell me about a challenging problem you solved."**
**A**: "The CI/CD pipeline was failing because it couldn't find the right iPhone simulator. I solved this by implementing dynamic device discovery that automatically finds available simulators using `xcodebuild -showdestinations`. This makes the pipeline robust across different CI environments and eliminates the need for hardcoded device names."

### Performance Questions
**Q: "How do you optimize app performance?"**
**A**: "I use value types for data models, lazy loading for services, and background threading for database operations. I implemented efficient caching strategies and optimized the UI with SwiftUI best practices. The app maintains smooth 60fps animations and uses minimal memory."

### Modern Swift Questions
**Q: "What modern Swift features do you use?"**
**A**: "I use async/await for network operations, Swift 6's `any` keyword for existential types, and protocol-oriented programming throughout. I leverage SwiftUI's reactive nature with `@Published` properties and implement proper error handling with custom error types."
